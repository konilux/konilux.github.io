      <description>In my day-to-day life, I would always encounter people excessively relying on me, especially on subjects like Science, English, and Math. I would also encounter people giving me a stern look, calling me a &amp;ldquo;know-it-all&amp;rdquo;. Sure, I recently reached some high achievements in class. But despite that, I genuinely think that I am no smarter than everybody else in my program, and I&amp;rsquo;m slowly growing tired of being treated otherwise because of the pressure and high expectations being brought on to me.</description>
