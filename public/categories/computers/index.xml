      <description>Well, not even a day had passed when I finally decided to dual boot Windows and Linux. And so, I grabbed a USB of mine and started up Rufus. I did all of the installation thinamajig, and before I knew it, I was finally running POP!_OS. This is my first time not using a virtual machine and installing a different operating system on a bare-bones machine, let alone dual booting two of them in one drive.</description>

      <description>With finally having a computer with Windows 11 installed, I was quite refreshed seeing a brand new face on the operating system I&amp;rsquo;ve used for all of my childhood. It also reminded me of this phase of mind where I would go out of my way just to customize it to my heart&amp;rsquo;s content, pushing the limits of the computer in the process. There was just a sparkle to me in seeing the computer in an appearance I want, especially when I feel inspired from looking at r/desktops and r/unixporn.</description>
