      <title>Deleting Social Media</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed big time gaps for whenever I post on this website. I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably because I also have social media apps to post my feelings on, especially Facebook. I believe I already have three accounts there already, one for each paradigms of my personality. But, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted all those social media apps on my phone and Ipad (Facebook, Youtube, Twitter/X, etc.) altogether, I can probably have more time expressing my thoughts here and in my personal journal in real life.</description>

      <description>I’ve been met with a heavy feeling lately, as if something was making my life worse. All these headaches I’ve been having, my poor performances in the past, all of those things had me wondering for a long time about the source of my issues. That is, until one day, I’ve finally narrowed it down to my gadgets.
I don’t really know if it’s because of the self-help and philosophical books I’ve read, but all of a sudden I just wanted to get my life straight.</description>
