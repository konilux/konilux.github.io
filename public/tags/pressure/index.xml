      <description>Ah, life. Itâ€™s what might be a minute phenomenon in an insignificant point of the universe. And yet, even this minuscule point strives for order and freedom by following thousands upon thousands of rules and standards.

By the time you are born into the world, you are provided by parents that you can only hope treats you well.</description>

But despite that, I genuinely think that I am no smarter than everybody else in my program, and I&amp;rsquo;m slowly growing tired of being treated otherwise because of the pressure and high expectations being brought on to me.</description>
