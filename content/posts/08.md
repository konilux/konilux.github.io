Well, not even a day had passed when I finally decided to dual boot Windows and Linux. And so, I grabbed a USB of mine and started up Rufus. I did all of the installation thinamajig, and before I knew it, I was finally running POP!_OS. This is my first time not using a virtual machine and installing a different operating system on a bare-bones machine, let alone dual booting two of them in one drive. So, the feeling I got when I saw the two of them coexist in this second-hand computer of mine transcends words.

Speaking from experience, the first thing I always do whenever I launch Linux on a virtual machine is to customize it to my heart's content. Likewise, I did the same on this machine, but this time more careful as this os is actually installed on my computer. Luckily, I already know my way around the terminal, so I did most of my work there. Heck, even this text right now is being written in the terminal. I ended up getting I setup I wouldn't normally get on a Windows machine because of it potentially breaking. It's a nighttime Tokyo and retro theme, and so far, I'm really happy with it.

Some pictures, of course:

So yeah, I just wanted to give an update to my last blog because of this. Sorry of these things do sound nerdy of me. But, customization is a really big hobby of mine because it gives out a new flavor and perspective on things. Even outside of opearating systems I find myself customizing my life from my room, stationaries, to my own personality. So, I consider myself to be an artsy type of person because of that.
