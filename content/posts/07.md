With finally having a computer with Windows 11 installed, I was quite refreshed seeing a brand new face on the operating system I've used for all of my childhood. It also reminded me of this phase of mind where I would go out of my way just to customize it to my heart's content, pushing the limits of the computer in the process. There was just a sparkle to me in seeing the computer in an appearance I want, especially when I feel inspired from looking at r/desktops and r/unixporn. 

Sometimes, I just wish I could just use Linux. Even right now, I'm considering that idea. Linux offers a lot more freedom with your desktop than your average Windows. Unlike Windows, Linux allows you to freely customize your desktop without the need of various third-party programs with a chance of it breaking your system. I mean, you could still break your system on Linux of course, but I feel that it's a lot more forgiving compared to Windows though.

As of now, I'm running Windows 11 22H2. I'm going for a Gruvbox theme as it's easy for the eyes to get used to. Honestly, I'm loving the aesthetic of the desktop right now, but I still yearn for more customization for the setup.

Here are some pictures of the aforementioned setup:
